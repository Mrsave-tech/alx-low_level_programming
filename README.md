# C PROGRAMMING
C is a low level, all-purpose and procedural programming language developed in bells lab by Dennis MarAcalister Ritche in 1972
the C language was developed as a result of developing the unix Operating sysytem in which ken thompson wrote the first program 
of the unix operating system used on a DEC PDP-7 computer using BCPL a programing language developed by Martin Richards. The unix 
operating sysytem program was writen in assembly code and it is very painful to debug assembly codes this lead to the development
of another language by ken thompson the B programing language. Denni Joined the Unix project using B language but realised that 
for the unix operating system to work on every system architecture he needs to find a way by developing a new language and then 
he first called the language the new B before it was called C programing. C is a pedigree to so many programing Language like 
Java, Python and many more, it is mostly used in building embedded system.

# As an aspiring software engineer it is importaant to know C and I will be doing a lot of task and learning as ALX S.E student
